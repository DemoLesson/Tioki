				Terms of Service
				</h2>
				<h3>
				Last Updated: July 11, 2012
				</h3>
				<p>
				These Terms of Service (the "Terms") govern your use of the online functionality made available at http://tioki.com by Demo Lesson, Inc. ("TIOKI," "we" and "us"), which enables you to upload information about yourself, including a video of you teaching a lesson, for access by potentially interested schools, school districts and other teacher-hiring organizations (the "Service"). To agree to these Terms, click "I agree" below.
				</p>
				<p>
				We reserve the right to modify these Terms prospectively at any time. We will post any changes to these Terms on our website, and will indicate the date the Terms were last revised. Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.
				</p>
				<h3>
				1. Eligibility.
				</h3>
				<p>
				Before accessing or using the Service, you must agree to these Terms. You are also required to register on our website and set up a profile with us (your "Profile").
				</p>
				<p>
				The Service is intended solely for teachers and aspiring teachers who are at least 18 years of age or older. Any registration by, use of or access to the Service by anyone under 18 is unauthorized, and in violation of these Terms. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older.
				</p>
				<p>
				The Service is provided to teachers free of charge, although you are responsible for any third-party fees that you may incur when accessing the Service, including Internet connection fees. We may, in the future, charge teachers to use of the Service, in which case you will be notified in advance of such change.
				</p>
				<h3>
				2.	Registration.
				</h3>
				<p>
				When you register with us, you will be asked to disclose certain personal information about yourself, including your name and email address. Please keep in mind that this information (and the rest of your Profile) will be made available to the schools and other organizations that are our customers and/or any other school or organization to which you send your Profile.
				</p>
				<p>
				You agree to provide us with true, accurate and complete information about yourself as requested in our registration process. You also agree to update the information on your Profile promptly as necessary to keep it current and accurate.
				</p>
				<h3>
				3.	Intellectual Property in the Service.

				Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, the Service, including all text, graphics, photos, videos, information, applications, software, sounds and any other content available through the Service, and their selection and arrangement in the Service, are the intellectual property of TIOKI or our licensors, with all rights reserved.
				</p>
				<p>
				Subject to the terms and conditions of these Terms, TIOKI grants you a non-exclusive, revocable, limited license to access and use the Service solely for the purposes set forth in these Terms. Any use of the Service other than as specifically authorized in these Terms, without the prior written permission of TIOKI, is strictly prohibited and will automatically terminate the foregoing license granted to you. Also, this license will terminate upon any termination of the Terms or upon any suspension, termination or cancellation of your access to the Service.

						</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
				<h3>
				4. User Conduct.
				</h3>
				<p>You represent, warrant and agree that all video and other content of any kind that is uploaded through your Profile or that you otherwise make available through the Service will not violate or infringe upon the rights of any third party, including any copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity or other intellectual property, personal or proprietary right.
				</p>
				<p>
				You agree not to upload or otherwise make available through the Service any of the following:
					<ul>
						<li>
						any content that is not your original work, unless you have permission from the rightful owner to post such content and to grant TIOKI all of the licensed rights granted herein;
						</li>
						<li>
						any private information of any third party;
						</li>
						<li>
						any content that is harmful, threatening, unlawful, defamatory, infringing, abusive, inflammatory, harassing, vulgar, obscene, fraudulent, invasive of privacy or publicity rights, hateful, or racially, ethnically or otherwise objectionable;
						</li>
						<li>
						any unsolicited or unauthorized advertising, solicitations, promotional materials, spam, or any other form of solicitation; or
						</li>
						<li>
						any software viruses or other computer code, viruses, malware, bots, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy or limit the functionality of any computer software or hardware or telecommunications equipment.
						</li>
					</ul>

				<h3>
				5.	User Content; License.
				</h3>
				<p>
				You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for all content, including all text, photos, videos and information, which you upload or otherwise make available through the Service (collectively, your "User Content"). You hereby represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize TIOKI to use all copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights in and to any and all of your User Content to enable inclusion and use of such User Content in the manner contemplated by the Service and these Terms. You may not upload or otherwise make available any content through the Service that you did not create or that you do not have permission to upload or otherwise make available.
				</p>
				<p>
				By uploading or otherwise making available your User Content through the Service, you automatically grant to TIOKI an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, publicly perform, publicly display, reformat, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part) and distribute such User Content for any purpose (including commercial, advertising and other purposes), on or in connection with the Service or the promotion thereof, to prepare derivative works of, or incorporate into other works, such User Content, and to grant and authorize sublicenses of any of the foregoing, including to allow schools, school districts and other customers of TIOKI the right to access such User Content. When you upload or otherwise make available your User Content through the Service, you also authorize and direct TIOKI to make such copies thereof as we deem necessary in order to facilitate the transmission and storage of such User Content.
				</p>
				<p>
				You should exercise caution, good sense and sound judgment in uploading content to the Service. You should not upload any content to the Service that you consider to be confidential or proprietary.
				</p>
				<p>
				You may remove any of your User Content from the Service at any time. If you remove your User Content, the license granted by you to TIOKI above will immediately terminate, except that (i) any User Content that had been downloaded by any customer of TIOKI prior to such removal may continue to be used indefinitely by such customer and its designees, and (ii) TIOKI may retain archived copies of your User Content for up to one year for customer audits and similar purposes. TIOKI does not assert any ownership over your User Content; rather, as between TIOKI and you, subject to the rights granted to us in these Terms, you retain full ownership of all of your User Content and any intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights associated with your User Content.
				</p>
				<p>
				You understand and agree that TIOKI may, but is not obligated to, review your User Content from time to time, and may delete or remove (without notice) from the Service any of your User Content in its sole discretion, for any reason or no reason, including User Content that in the sole judgment of TIOKI violates these Terms, or which might be offensive or illegal, or that might harm or violate the rights or threaten the safety of users or others.

				6.	No Endorsement.
				</h3>

				</p>
				<p>
				In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, we have adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at our sole discretion, users of the Service who are deemed to be repeat infringers. TIOKI may also at its sole discretion limit access to the Service and/or terminate the Profiles of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.
				</p>

				8.	Trademarks.
				</h3>
				<p>

				</p>
				<p>
				If you decide to leave the Service and access a Third-Party Site or to use or install any Third-Party Content, you do so at your own risk and you should be aware that these Terms and our other policies no longer govern.
