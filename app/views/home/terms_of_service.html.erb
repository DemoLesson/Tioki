<p><h7>Last Updated: July 11, 2012</h7></p>

<p>These Terms of Service (the “Terms”) govern your use of the online functionality made available by Demo Lesson, Inc. (“DLI,” “we” and “us”), which enables you to upload information about yourself, including a video of you teaching a lesson, for access by potentially interested schools, school districts and other teacher-hiring organizations (the “Service”).  To agree to these Terms, click “I agree” below.</p>

<p>	We reserve the right to modify these Terms prospectively at any time.  We will post any changes to these Terms on our website, and will indicate the date the Terms were last revised.  Your continued use of the Service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
	
	<h7> 1. Eligibility.</h7>
	
	<p>Before accessing or using the Service, you must agree to these Terms.  You are also required to register on our website and set up a profile with us (your “Profile”).</p>
	
	<p>The Service is intended solely for teachers and aspiring teachers who are at least 18 years of age or older.  Any registration by, use of or access to the Service by anyone under 18 is unauthorized, and in violation of these Terms.  By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older.</p> 
	 
	<p>The Service is provided to teachers free of charge, although you are responsible for any third-party fees that you may incur when accessing the Service, including Internet connection fees.  We may, in the future, charge teachers to use of the Service, in which case you will be notified in advance of such change. </p>
	
	<h7>2.	Registration.</h7>
	
	<p>When you register with us, you will be asked to disclose certain personal information about yourself, including your name and email address.

	   <p> You understand and agree that you are solely responsible for all content, including all text, photos, videos and information, which you upload or otherwise make available through the Service (collectively, your “User Content”).  You hereby represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to use and authorize DLI to use all copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights in and to any and all of your User Content to enable inclusion and use of such User Content in the manner contemplated by the Service and these Terms.

	   <p> By uploading or otherwise making available your User Content through the Service, you automatically grant to DLI an irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive, transferable, fully paid, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, publicly perform, publicly display, reformat, translate, excerpt (in whole or in part) and distribute such User Content for any purpose (including commercial, advertising and other purposes), on or in connection with the Service or the promotion thereof, to prepare derivative works of, or incorporate into other works, such User Content, and to grant and authorize sublicenses of any of the foregoing, including to allow schools, school districts and other customers of DLI the right to access such User Content.  When you upload or otherwise make available your User Content through the Service, you also authorize and direct DLI to make such copies thereof as we deem necessary in order to facilitate the transmission and storage of such User Content.</p>

	  <p>	You understand and agree that DLI may, but is not obligated to, review your User Content from time to time, and may delete or remove (without notice) from the Service any of your User Content in its sole discretion, for any reason or no reason, including User Content that in the sole judgment of DLI violates these Terms, or which might be offensive or illegal, or that might harm or violate the rights or threaten the safety of users or others.</p>
