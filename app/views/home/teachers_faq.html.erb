<p>
	<b>Q: Can I complete part of my profile and work on the rest at a later time?</b><br/>
	A: Yes, you can save what you have worked on and continue at a later time. Remember, schools will not have access to your profile until you apply to their positions, so feel free to complete your profile over time. 
</p>

<p>
	<b>Q: Is my profile visible to everyone?</b><br/>
	A: No. Your profile is currently visible only by the schools to which you apply, or the individuals to whom you grant access through the “Guest Passcode” system. 
</p>

<p>
	<b>Q: What is the “Guest Passcode” and how does it work?</b><br/>
	A: The “Guest Passcode” is a way for you to market yourself to schools and individuals who are not on the Demo Lesson platform. Perhaps you are applying to a job that is not yet posting positions on Demo Lesson. No worries! Simply click on “Edit Profile” and copy the unique “Guest Passcode” link that we have assigned to you. Simply give this link to any school you are applying to, and they will receive free access to your complete profile!
