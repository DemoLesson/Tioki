				Kelly Becker is an epic unicorn wrangler. Kelly started programming at age 13 and is proudly 100% self-taught.

When Kelly is not writing software or studying the latest technology you will find her playing tabletop games and hanging with friends. Kelly's favorite food is good tuna sandwiches and off-brand root beer, and her favorite evening plans are debating with her fianc√© Ben over a nice dinner.
