				Mandela Schumacher-Hodge
				</p>
				<p>
				Mandela graduated from Pepperdine University with a Bachelor of Arts in Intercultural Communication and a minor in Spanish. Mandela was a Teach for America corps member and spent her first year teaching 6th grade Humanities at a Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) middle school in South Central Los Angeles. She continued working through the summer as a Literacy teacher at a Partnership for Uplifting Schools (PUC) middle school in East LA, and then went on to teach another two years at a Youth Policy Institute (YPI) middle school in Pacoima, CA. 
				</p>
				<p>
				While at Bert Corona, Mandela was voted Lead Teacher, adding various new administrator and teacher-coaching and mentorship duties to her role. During this period, Mandela also obtained a multiple-subject teaching credential and Masters Degree in Education Administration and Policy from Loyola Marymount University. Most recently, Mandela was a Ph.D. candidate at the prestigious UCLA Graduate School of Education.

				Mandela has had the unique experience of seeing the education industry from a variety of vantage points - as a teacher in the school system, as an education researcher in a doctoral program, and as a co-founder of an education company. Mandela is passionate about empowering educators to showcase their unique talents and skills, take ownership of the public branding of their profession, and broaden their network to expand their influence.
