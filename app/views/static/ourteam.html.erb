				Brian Martinez

				<p class="founder-title"> 
				Co-founder & CEO
				</p>
				<p>
				Despite having grown up in South Central Los Angeles and attending some of the lowest performing schools in the state, Brian was able to rise above his circumstances to become the first in his family to graduate from college. Brian understands the detrimental effect a subpar education can have on an entire community, but is uplifted by his personal experiences with great educators who helped alter his life trajectory. Prior to co-founding Tioki, Brian studied Business Economics, Entrepreneurship, and Accounting at UC Santa Barbara, where he co-founded the medical device startup AcceloMed Technologies. After graduating from UCSB, Brian completed the Riordan Fellows Program at the UCLA Anderson School of Management, and served as the alumni representative on the Board of Directors of South Central Scholars. Now, with Tioki, Brian focuses on overall strategy, product strategy, design, financing, and business development.
