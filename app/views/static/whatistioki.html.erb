		What is Tioki?
		</h1>
		<h3>
		Our Philosophy
		</h3>
		<p>
		We believe that educators are the real superstars of the world! Stepping up to the plate and taking responsibility for educating, preparing, and inspiring the world's growing population is no small feat, and we believe that educators deserve to be recognized for the incredible work they do. But we also believe that educators should not wait for others to start the applause. Educators, themselves, must step into the spotlight, showcase their skills, connect with others, and be proactive in taking control of their public image. At Tioki, we believe that change starts from within, and we empower educators with the tool to change the way the world sees them.
